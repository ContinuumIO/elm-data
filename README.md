This repo has example data for testing the elm package.

Make a folder for each major file type, e.g. hdf4, h5, netcdf4, geotiff

Over time we may make more folder of specific examples of each of those types.

Add a note about where you got the files you add to this repo and ensure we can redistribute them.
